## Use Prepared Statements Correctly with Pooling

Prepared statements are tied to individual database connections. In transaction-mode pooling, connections are shared, causing conflicts.

**Incorrect (named prepared statements with transaction pooling):**

```sql
-- Named prepared statement
prepare get_user as select * from users where id = $1;

-- In transaction mode pooling, next request may get different connection
execute get_user(123);
-- ERROR: prepared statement "get_user" does not exist
```

**Correct (use unnamed statements or session mode):**

```sql
-- Option 1: Use unnamed prepared statements (most ORMs do this automatically)
-- The query is prepared and executed in a single protocol message

-- Option 2: Explicit SQL PREPARE/EXECUTE must use the same backend.
-- In transaction pooling, keep their full lifecycle in one transaction
-- if the chosen pooler supports that workflow; deallocation alone is insufficient.

-- Option 3: Use session mode pooling (port 5432 vs 6543)
-- Connection is held for entire session, prepared statements persist
```

Check your driver settings:

```sql
-- Many drivers use prepared statements by default
-- node-postgres: omit the query config name to avoid named prepared statements
-- JDBC: prepareThreshold=0 to disable
```

Pooler protocol-level prepared-statement support varies by product, version and configuration. Check the actual pooler and driver documentation before selecting a mode.
